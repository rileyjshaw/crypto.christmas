We’ll store most of our other passwords within the password manager. Since\\nwe have quick, secure access to our passwords whenever we need them, they don’t need to be memorable. So let’s start\\nusing passwords like “<em><code>t4Nr&amp;A6yr9pWX2k3o$l6J5Rs</code></em>”!</p>\\n<p>Your password manager can generate new passwords like this automatically; if you’re using LastPass, it’s under “Generate\\nSecure Password”. Along with obvious security advantages, random passwords remove the cognitive load of remembering\\nindividual site passwords. It’ll also be easier to replace your passwords going forward, since you haven’t committed the\\noriginal to memory.</p>\\n<p>Along with your passwords, it’s a good idea to replace answers for “Security questions”. These are things like <em>“What\\nstreet did you grow up on?”, “What is your pet’s name?”,</em> or <em>“What is your favorite band?”.</em> Answers to these questions\\nare notoriously easy to guess or infer from social profiles. Once we’re done today, we want things to look like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>What street did you grow up on?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>e8*4qWn45&amp;mbx8Y^O&amp;i!cn6V</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your pet’s name?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>L2pOY0@@C^WaR#B$YC!ffC$u</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your favorite band?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>0*66$20$%65%##8*$3$80^^8</code></em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If a site supports it, you’ll want to set up “Two-Factor Authentication” using your mobile device. This protects you if\\nsomeone manages to gain access to your password or passphrase.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Pick four websites that hold important information or privileges. For example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Your bank website</li>\\n<li>Your primary or work email</li>\\n<li>Social profiles (eg. Facebook)</li>\\n<li>File storage (eg. Dropbox)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For each of these sites, log in using your existing password. Use your password manager to generate a new password. If\\nyou’re using Lastpass, it’s under “Generate Secure Password”. Make sure to save the new password in your password\\nmanager.</p>\\n<p>Next, replace any security questions using the same steps above. Many password managers allow you to store secure notes\\nalong with a login entry; this is a good place to store the answers to your security questions.</p>\\n<p>Finally, look around for a “Two-factor auth” or “2FA” option.

We’ll store most of our other passwords within the password manager. Since\\nwe have quick, secure access to our passwords whenever we need them, they don’t need to be memorable. So let’s start\\nusing passwords like “<em><code>t4Nr&amp;A6yr9pWX2k3o$l6J5Rs</code></em>”!</p>\\n<p>Your password manager can generate new passwords like this automatically; if you’re using LastPass, it’s under “Generate\\nSecure Password”. Along with obvious security advantages, random passwords remove the cognitive load of remembering\\nindividual site passwords. It’ll also be easier to replace your passwords going forward, since you haven’t committed the\\noriginal to memory.</p>\\n<p>Along with your passwords, it’s a good idea to replace answers for “Security questions”. These are things like <em>“What\\nstreet did you grow up on?”, “What is your pet’s name?”,</em> or <em>“What is your favorite band?”.</em> Answers to these questions\\nare notoriously easy to guess or infer from social profiles. Once we’re done today, we want things to look like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>What street did you grow up on?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>e8*4qWn45&amp;mbx8Y^O&amp;i!cn6V</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your pet’s name?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>L2pOY0@@C^WaR#B$YC!ffC$u</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your favorite band?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>0*66$20$%65%##8*$3$80^^8</code></em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If a site supports it, you’ll want to set up “Two-Factor Authentication” using your mobile device. This protects you if\\nsomeone manages to gain access to your password or passphrase.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Pick four websites that hold important information or privileges. For example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Your bank website</li>\\n<li>Your primary or work email</li>\\n<li>Social profiles (eg. Facebook)</li>\\n<li>File storage (eg. Dropbox)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For each of these sites, log in using your existing password. Use your password manager to generate a new password. If\\nyou’re using Lastpass, it’s under “Generate Secure Password”. Make sure to save the new password in your password\\nmanager.</p>\\n<p>Next, replace any security questions using the same steps above. Many password managers allow you to store secure notes\\nalong with a login entry; this is a good place to store the answers to your security questions.</p>\\n<p>Finally, look around for a “Two-factor auth” or “2FA” option. If it exists, set it up using the\\n<a href=\\\"/2016/2/\\\">authenticator app that you downloaded yesterday</a> or your mobile phone number.</p>\\n<h3>Bonus</h3>\\n<p>Before we finish, sign up for <a href=\\\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe\\\">Have I Been Pwned</a>.

A quick note on recovery keys: you may be\\nprompted to store a copy of your key in the cloud. Doing so is not advised:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I recommend that you don’t save a copy of your recovery key to your account. If you do, [Microsoft, Apple] — and by\\nextension anyone (they) are compelled to share data with, such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies, or anyone\\nwho hacks into [Microsoft, Apple]’s servers and can steal data — will have the ability to unlock your encrypted disk.\\nInstead, you should save your recovery key to a file on another drive or print it.

The program you’re using to read this article is probably full of\\ncracks and faults, often referred to as “bugs”.</p>\\n<p>For the most part, bugs are innocuous. A webpage may show up with parts\\nmissing, your device might freeze—but your security isn’t at risk.</p>\\n<p>Except, sometimes it is.</p>\\n<p>If a software team discovers a critical issue with their product, they usually\\nrelease a fix. By keeping software up-to-date, you get fixes as soon as\\npossible.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>For this section, we won’t cover specific devices, app stores, or marketplaces\\nsince there are too many to cover comprehensively. Instead, we’ll talk about\\n<em>types</em> of software that you can update. Spend time going through your computer\\nand phone to see if you can find any out-of-date software.</p>\\n<p>While you’re applying updates, look for the option to <strong>enable auto-updates</strong>;\\nthis removes the manual step for next time.</p>\\n<h3>Operating system</h3>\\n<p>Your operating system—be it Windows, Android, OS X, Linux, iOS, or other—likely\\nhas the most “bang for your buck” update-wise. Every program you run goes\\nthrough the operating system, so a flaw here can be bad news.</p>\\n<p>Just keeping your operating system up-to-date is not enough; exploits in\\nindividual programs can be equally harmful.</p>\\n<h3>App store / marketplace</h3>\\n<p>If your device manages apps and programs through a centralized “app store”,\\nthere’s usually an option to update everything in one swoop. This can extend\\nbeyond official device ecosystems; <a href=\\\"http://store.steampowered.com/\\\">Steam</a>, for example, is a single\\nprogram that manages several game programs.</p>\\n<p>App stores are a good chance to evaluate the condition of many programs at\\nonce, but you may still have programs that were installed outside of your\\ndevice’s app store.</p>\\n<h3>Browser plugins</h3>\\n<p>From PDF readers to plugins like Adobe Flash, plugins and extensions that run\\nin your browser can get out of date quickly and cause havoc.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./2016/8.md\n// module id = 514\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Audit your integrations\",\"body\":\"<h2>Theory</h2>\\n<p>Some products are built on-top of larger services like Facebook, Gmail, or Dropbox.

But they last <em>forever,</em> which means most of us have a handful of\\nforgotten services that still access our accounts.</p>\\n<p>In addition to services we forgot are the ones we never noticed in the first place.
