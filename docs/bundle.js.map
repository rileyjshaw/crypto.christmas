We’ll store most of our other passwords within the password manager. Since\\nwe have quick, secure access to our passwords whenever we need them, they don’t need to be memorable. So let’s start\\nusing passwords like “<em><code>t4Nr&amp;A6yr9pWX2k3o$l6J5Rs</code></em>”!</p>\\n<p>Your password manager can generate new passwords like this automatically; if you’re using LastPass, it’s under “Generate\\nSecure Password”. Along with obvious security advantages, random passwords remove the cognitive load of remembering\\nindividual site passwords. It’ll also be easier to replace your passwords going forward, since you haven’t committed the\\noriginal to memory.</p>\\n<p>Along with your passwords, it’s a good idea to replace answers for “Security questions”. These are things like <em>“What\\nstreet did you grow up on?”, “What is your pet’s name?”,</em> or <em>“What is your favorite band?”.</em> Answers to these questions\\nare notoriously easy to guess or infer from social profiles. Once we’re done today, we want things to look like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>What street did you grow up on?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>e8*4qWn45&amp;mbx8Y^O&amp;i!cn6V</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your pet’s name?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>L2pOY0@@C^WaR#B$YC!ffC$u</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your favorite band?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>0*66$20$%65%##8*$3$80^^8</code></em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If a site supports it, you’ll want to set up “Two-Factor Authentication” using your mobile device. This protects you if\\nsomeone manages to gain access to your password or passphrase.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Pick four websites that hold important information or privileges. For example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Your bank website</li>\\n<li>Your primary or work email</li>\\n<li>Social profiles (eg. Facebook)</li>\\n<li>File storage (eg. Dropbox)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For each of these sites, log in using your existing password. Use your password manager to generate a new password. If\\nyou’re using Lastpass, it’s under “Generate Secure Password”. Make sure to save the new password in your password\\nmanager.</p>\\n<p>Next, replace any security questions using the same steps above. Many password managers allow you to store secure notes\\nalong with a login entry; this is a good place to store the answers to your security questions.</p>\\n<p>Finally, look around for a “Two-factor auth” or “2FA” option. If it exists, set it up using the\\n<a href=\\\"/2016/2/\\\">authenticator app that you downloaded yesterday</a> or your mobile phone number.</p>\\n<h3>Bonus</h3>\\n<p>Before we finish, sign up for <a href=\\\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe\\\">Have I Been Pwned</a>.

Each day is split into a short &quot;Theory&quot;\\nsection followed by some “Homework”. On our first day together, we’ll use dice to generate a secure passphrase.</p>\\n<h2>Theory</h2>\\n<p>From <a href=\\\"https://github.com/freedomofpress/encryption-works/blob/master/encryption_works.md\\\">Freedom of the Press’s “Encryption Works”</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The first meaningful action you can take towards ensuring your digital security is to protect your computer and online accounts with a strong password. This is the first—and most important—line of defense between you and anyone with physical access to your computer who wants to impersonate you or steal your data.</p>\\n<p>Traditionally, computer users were encouraged to create and choose a password and attach some numbers onto the end of it. This would lead to passwords such as Tr0ub4dor&amp;3, to reference a popular <a href=\\\"https://xkcd.com/936/\\\">XKCD comic</a>.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/password_strength.png\\\" alt=\\\"A comic, concluding that through 20 years of effort, we've successfully trained everyone to use passwords that are hard for humans to remember (eg. &quot;Tr0ub4dor&quot;), but easy for computers to guess (eg. &quot;correct horse battery staple&quot;).\\\"></p>\\n<p>…to invent a passphrase consisting of unconnected words such as “correct horse battery staple,” is good advice, but it’s surprisingly hard to come up with four or five words that are truly unconnected and to choose words at random.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>And so, we use something that’s <em>good</em> at randomness: a die! We won’t need to break out our board games every time we create a new password<sup class=\\\"footnote-ref\\\"><a href=\\\"#fn1\\\" id=\\\"fnref1\\\">[1]</a></sup>, but today that’s exactly what we’re going to do.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Generate a secure “Diceware” passphrase by following these steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Roll a die (physical dice are <em>highly</em> preferable to digital ones for this step).</li>\\n<li>Write the number down.</li>\\n<li>Repeat this until you have a five-digit number.</li>\\n<li>Find it on <a href=\\\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt\\\">this word list</a>.</li>\\n<li>Pick at least five more words using steps 1 to 4.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And there you have it; a brand new passphrase!

We’ll store most of our other passwords within the password manager. Since\\nwe have quick, secure access to our passwords whenever we need them, they don’t need to be memorable. So let’s start\\nusing passwords like “<em><code>t4Nr&amp;A6yr9pWX2k3o$l6J5Rs</code></em>”!</p>\\n<p>Your password manager can generate new passwords like this automatically; if you’re using LastPass, it’s under “Generate\\nSecure Password”. Along with obvious security advantages, random passwords remove the cognitive load of remembering\\nindividual site passwords. It’ll also be easier to replace your passwords going forward, since you haven’t committed the\\noriginal to memory.</p>\\n<p>Along with your passwords, it’s a good idea to replace answers for “Security questions”. These are things like <em>“What\\nstreet did you grow up on?”, “What is your pet’s name?”,</em> or <em>“What is your favorite band?”.</em> Answers to these questions\\nare notoriously easy to guess or infer from social profiles. Once we’re done today, we want things to look like this:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>What street did you grow up on?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>e8*4qWn45&amp;mbx8Y^O&amp;i!cn6V</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your pet’s name?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>L2pOY0@@C^WaR#B$YC!ffC$u</code></em></p>\\n<p><strong>What is your favorite band?</strong></p>\\n<p><em><code>0*66$20$%65%##8*$3$80^^8</code></em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>If a site supports it, you’ll want to set up “Two-Factor Authentication” using your mobile device. This protects you if\\nsomeone manages to gain access to your password or passphrase.</p>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Pick four websites that hold important information or privileges. For example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Your bank website</li>\\n<li>Your primary or work email</li>\\n<li>Social profiles (eg. Facebook)</li>\\n<li>File storage (eg. Dropbox)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For each of these sites, log in using your existing password. Use your password manager to generate a new password. If\\nyou’re using Lastpass, it’s under “Generate Secure Password”. Make sure to save the new password in your password\\nmanager.</p>\\n<p>Next, replace any security questions using the same steps above. Many password managers allow you to store secure notes\\nalong with a login entry; this is a good place to store the answers to your security questions.</p>\\n<p>Finally, look around for a “Two-factor auth” or “2FA” option. If it exists, set it up using the\\n<a href=\\\"/2016/2/\\\">authenticator app that you downloaded yesterday</a> or your mobile phone number.</p>\\n<h3>Bonus</h3>\\n<p>Before we finish, sign up for <a href=\\\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe\\\">Have I Been Pwned</a>.

Your homework\\nbelow is a summary of the actions described in that article, but:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>If you want to encrypt your hard disk and have it truly help protect your data, you shouldn’t just flip it on; you\\nshould know the basics of what disk encryption protects, what it doesn’t protect, and how to avoid common mistakes\\nthat could let an attacker easily bypass your encryption.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Break out your dice, because it’s time to <a href=\\\"/2016/1/\\\">create another passphrase</a>. This time, it’ll be used to derypt your\\nhard drive.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve created a new passphrase, it’s time to encrypt your drive. A quick note on recovery keys: you may be\\nprompted to store a copy of your key in the cloud. Doing so is not advised:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I recommend that you don’t save a copy of your recovery key to your account. If you do, [Microsoft, Apple] — and by\\nextension anyone (they) are compelled to share data with, such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies, or anyone\\nwho hacks into [Microsoft, Apple]’s servers and can steal data — will have the ability to unlock your encrypted disk.\\nInstead, you should save your recovery key to a file on another drive or print it.

This can extend\\nbeyond official device ecosystems; <a href=\\\"http://store.steampowered.com/\\\">Steam</a>, for example, is a single\\nprogram that manages several game programs.</p>\\n<p>App stores are a good chance to evaluate the condition of many programs at\\nonce, but you may still have programs that were installed outside of your\\ndevice’s app store.</p>\\n<h3>Browser plugins</h3>\\n<p>From PDF readers to plugins like Adobe Flash, plugins and extensions that run\\nin your browser can get out of date quickly and cause havoc.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./2016/8.md\n// module id = 510\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Audit your integrations\",\"body\":\"<p>We’ll release this on January 2nd, the ninth day of Christmas!</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./2016/9.md\n// module id = 511\n// module chunks = 0","import React from 'react'\nimport ReactCSSTransitionGroup from 'react-addons-css-transition-group'\nimport {createComponent} from 'react-fela'\nimport {Link} from 'react-router'\n\nimport {config} from 'config'\nimport InlineIcon from 'components/InlineIcon'\nimport 'css/article.sass'\nimport {arrowLeftIcon, arrowRightIcon} from 'utils/icons'\n\n\nconst styles = {\n\tcontainer: props => ({\n\t\tposition: 'relative',\n\t}),\n\n\tday: props => ({\n\t\tdisplay: 'inline-block',\n\t\tmarginBottom: 0,\n\t\tposition: 'relative',\n\t}),\n\n\tarrow: ({side}) => ({\n\t\tfontSize: '0.3em',\n\t\topacity: 0.8,\n\t\tposition: 'absolute',\n\t\t[side]: '-4em',\n\n\t\t':hover': {\n\t\t\tcolor: '#fff',\n\t\t},\n\n\t\t// HACK(riley)\n\t\t'@media (max-width: 920px)': {\n\t\t\tfontSize: '0.2em',\n\t\t\t[side]: '-3em',\n\t\t},\n\t}),\n};\n\nmodule.exports = React.createClass({\n\tpropTypes () {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\troute: React.PropTypes.object,\n\t\t};\n\t},\n\n\tgetInitialState () {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t// Used to determine the CSS transition direction between pages.\n\t\t\tdirection: '',\n\t\t};\n\t},\n\n\tcontextTypes: {\n\t\trenderer: React.PropTypes.object.isRequired,\n\t},\n\n\ttransitionTo (direction) {\n\t\t// HACK(riley): ReactCSSTransitionGroup is generally bad.
