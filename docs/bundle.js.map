We’ll store most of our other passwords within the password manager. Since\\nwe have quick, secure access to our passwords whenever we need them, they don’t need to be memorable. So let’s start\\nusing passwords like “<em><code>t4Nr&amp;A6yr9pWX2k3o$l6J5Rs</code></em>”!</p>\\n<p>Your password manager can generate new passwords like this. Random passwords have obvious security benefits, but there’s\\nmore. They also remove the cognitive load of remembering individual site passwords. It’s easy to replace your passwords\\nwhen you haven’t committed them to memory in the first place!</p>\\n<p>Along with your passwords, it’s a good idea to redo your “Security questions”. These are things like <em>“What street did\\nyou grow up on?”, “What is your pet’s name?”,</em> or <em>“What is your favorite band?”.</em> Answers to these questions are\\nnotoriously easy to guess or infer from social profiles.

Your homework\\nbelow is a summary of the actions described in that article, but:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>If you want to encrypt your hard disk and have it truly help protect your data, you shouldn’t just flip it on; you\\nshould know the basics of what disk encryption protects, what it doesn’t protect, and how to avoid common mistakes\\nthat could let an attacker easily bypass your encryption.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Homework</h2>\\n<p>Break out your dice, because it’s time to <a href=\\\"/2016/1/\\\">create another passphrase</a>.

A quick note on recovery keys: you may be\\nprompted to store a copy of your key in the cloud. Doing so is not advised:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>I recommend that you don’t save a copy of your recovery key to your account. If you do, [Microsoft, Apple] — and by\\nextension anyone (they) are compelled to share data with, such as law enforcement or intelligence agencies, or anyone\\nwho hacks into [Microsoft, Apple]’s servers and can steal data — will have the ability to unlock your encrypted disk.\\nInstead, you should save your recovery key to a file on another drive or print it.
