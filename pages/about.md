# About Crypto Christmas

Keeping your digital information safe is important. It can also feel overwhelming.  With resources like
[Freedom of the Press's "Encryption Works"][1] and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation's "Security Starter Pack"][2],
it's becoming easier to take back your online privacy. But even some "starter" guides can feel daunting.

This site aims to provide simple, actionable steps to improve your digital security and privacy. By the end you'll be in
better shape, and hopefully realize that security is a process, not a product.

_Disclaimer: we share no affiliation with Christmas in any religious or consumerist facets. We just thought the URL
sounded cute._

It's Cryptmas all year 'round.
