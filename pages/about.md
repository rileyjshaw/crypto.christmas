# About Crypto Christmas

Keeping your digital information safe is important. It can also feel overwhelming. With resources like
[Freedom of the Press’s “Encryption Works”][1] and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Security Starter Pack”][2],
it’s becoming easier to take back your online privacy. But even “starter” guides can feel daunting.

This site provides simple, actionable steps to improve your digital security and privacy. By the end you’ll be in better
shape, and realize that security is a process, not a product.

It’s Cryptmas all year ’round.
