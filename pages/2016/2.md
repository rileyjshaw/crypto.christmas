title: Install a password manager
---

Today we're going to install some tools onto your computer and/or phone to keep track of your passwords.

### Theory

Good passwords are hard to come by. A strong password is:

- long
- random
- not reused elsewhere

It would be nearly impossible to remember all of our passwords if we hit all of these points. To improve, we're going to
need help. Which is where password managers come in! They generate secure passwords, and then store them for us to refer
to later.

### Homework

For most folks, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/) are good
options. Like anything in this guide, feel free to research alternatives. Once you've decided, install the applications
and set them up using the passphrase you generated yesterday.

Poke around; tomorrow we're going to [upgrade some of your passwords](/2016/3).

### Bonus

- If your password manager asks to import old passwords during setup, scan the list. Are there any old accounts that you
  can close since you're not using them anymore?
