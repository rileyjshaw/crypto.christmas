title: Install some browser extensions
---

## Theory

By using the "free" web, you agree to share personal information with the highest bidder. Corporations collect and sell
your information on web search, social media, news sites; it's ubiquitous. As the following video puts it,

> This has got to be one of the most invasive advertising systems ever devised.

<div
	class="video-wrapper"
	style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"
>
	<iframe
		width="560"
		height="315"
		src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pFX2P7JLwA"
		frameborder="0"
		allowfullscreen
		style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
	></iframe>
</div>

Browser extensions help protect your privacy by limiting what's sent to ad networks and other snoops. Some free options
are listed below.

## Homework

Install the following browser plugins:

- [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
- [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)

### Bonus

Navigate to your list of installed browser plugins. Can you delete any? Plugins and extensions can cause privacy leaks.
A good guideline is if you're no-longer using it, delete it.
