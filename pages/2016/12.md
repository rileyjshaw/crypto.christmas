title: Delete it
---

Over the past eleven days we’ve [scanned a list of your existing accounts](/2016/2/), audited your
[browser extensions](/2016/7/) and [app permissions](/2016/9/), and [updated old software](/2016/8/). By this point, you
probably have a good picture of all the services that you’re subscribed to.

The easiest way to ensure a product isn’t encroaching on your privacy is to avoid or disable the product. Most of us
subscribe to more digital products than we actually use. By limiting our surface area, we reduce the risk of a security
breech. It’s similar to [disabling old devices](/2016/10/) once we’re done with them.

## Homework

Take stock of all the services that hold information about you. Consider deleting one, or several, of your accounts.

Of the software you use, social media apps are probably the most intrusive. Not only do they store the same data as
other apps (location, behavior, ad clicks), but they probably publicize your personal information. If you want to hold
on to your data but don’t need it broadcasted, many services allow you to export posts to your hard drive. For example:

- [Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467)
- [Twitter](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160)

When it comes to account deletion, make sure you _delete the account itself, not just the app or bookmark._ This option
is usually available from a settings menu. For example, this is how to [delete your Facebook account][Delete Facebook].
